# Real Estate Exam Prep Game

This project is a small quiz app built with React and Vite. It shows sample questions for the Massachusetts real estate exam and tracks your progress locally.

## Development

Run `npm install` before starting the development server with `npm run dev`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Features

- Multiple choice questions drawn from several topics
- Countdown timer for each quiz session
- Score tracking and history saved to `localStorage`

The app is a work in progress and is intended for experiments with question navigation and simple gamification.
Tailwind's PostCSS plugin comes from the `tailwindcss` package, so no extra PostCSS plugin is required.
