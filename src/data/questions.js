          "D": "A stack of lumber stored in the garage"
        },
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Real property includes land and attachments that are intended to be permanent. A built-in fireplace that is attached to the home is a fixture and thus part of the real property, whereas freestanding appliances and harvested crops are generally personal property."

        },
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A mortgage lien is a financial encumbrance on the title; it’s a claim or charge on the property as security for a debt. A lease is a possessory interest (not typically called an encumbrance on title by itself), a fence is part of property, and a revocable license is permission that doesn’t run with the land."

        "options": {
          "A": "It has no effect on property title or value",
          "B": "It may become an easement by prescription if not addressed",
          "C": "The owners must immediately remove the structure",
          "D": "The encroachment gives the encroaching owner legal title to the land"
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If an encroachment (like a fence or structure) exists openly and continuously for the statutory period without permission, it could lead to an easement by prescription, allowing the encroachment to continue legally. It does not automatically transfer title (which would require adverse possession conditions and a legal action)."

        "explanation": "A *judgment lien* is a general lien, arising from a court judgment, that can attach to all property (real or personal) of the debtor in the county where the judgment is recorded. Mortgages, property tax liens, and mechanics liens are typically specific to one property."

          "D": "A deed restriction running with the land"
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Utility companies typically hold *easements in gross*, which benefit a company or person rather than another parcel of land. These allow access to property for utility lines maintenance. They are not revocable at will like a license would be."

          "D": "Using an easement appurtenant as granted in a deed"
        },
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Adverse possession is a legal doctrine by which someone can acquire title to another’s land if they openly, continuously, notoriously (and sometimes under claim of right or color of title) use the land for the statutory period without permission. Simply trespassing occasionally or renting (with permission) does not meet the criteria."

          "C": "Percolating rights",
          "D": "Appropriative rights"
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Riparian rights are the rights of landowners whose land borders *moving water* like rivers and streams. Littoral rights refer to land bordering *stationary water* like lakes or the ocean. Water use may also be governed by the doctrine of prior appropriation in some states (not typically in the eastern U.S.)."

          "D": "Whoever owns the stream or riverbed"
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In states following the *prior appropriation* doctrine (generally western states), water rights are allocated by the state through a permit system, based on beneficial use, rather than by land adjacency. This means the right to use water is granted to those who have state permission, often prioritizing who first put the water to beneficial use."

          "D": "Their interest is a future interest that begins after the current estate ends."
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A life estate is a form of freehold estate where the life tenant has ownership rights for the duration of a designated life (usually their own). They cannot will it to heirs (since it ends at death) and they must not commit waste (not damage or devalue the property for the remainder interest holder)."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Joint tenancy requires the unities of time, title, interest, and possession, and it includes the right of survivorship. In this scenario, since they explicitly want survivorship, they hold the property as *joint tenants*. (Tenancy by entirety is for married couples in certain states, and also includes survivorship, but the question doesn’t specify marriage.)"

          "D": "It is only available to spouses."
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "In a *tenancy in common*, co-owners may hold unequal shares (though they can be equal) and each owner can sell, transfer, or will their interest independently. There is no right of survivorship in a tenancy in common – when a co-owner dies, their interest passes to their heirs, not automatically to the other co-owners."

          "D": "The new owner has no legal claim because joint tenancy forbids transfer"
        },
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "When a joint tenant sells their interest, the joint tenancy is broken with respect to that share, because the unity of time and title are disrupted. The new owner will be a *tenant in common* with the remaining owner(s), who still hold their shares jointly amongst themselves."

A buyer of a coop unit gets a *share of stock* in that corporation and a *proprietary lease* to occupy a specific unit. They do not receive a deed because they don’t own the real estate directly (the corporation does)."

        "explanation": "Many time-shares are sold as *interval ownership* where the buyer owns a fee simple interest in a unit for a set period each year (e.g., one week every year in perpetuity). This differs from right-to-use time-shares, which are more like long-term leases that eventually expire."

        "explanation": "In the sales comparison approach, the appraiser looks for recently sold properties that are as similar as possible to the subject in location, size, age, style, and other characteristics. For a 20-year-old house, comparables should also be older homes in that area or similar areas, not brand-new homes in a different type of development.

Lenders use two main DTIs: the housing ratio (front-end, which is housing payment PITI divided by income) and the total debt ratio (back-end, including housing plus other debt payments divided by income). These ratios help lenders assess whether the borrower can comfortably afford the new loan payment."

          "B": "A mortgage that secures both real property and personal property (e.g., furnished condo including appliances)",

          "D": "A mortgage that includes construction and permanent financing together"
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A *package mortgage* is one where the loan is secured by real estate *and* personal property. For example, financing the purchase of a fully furnished condo might use a package mortgage that covers both the unit and the included furniture/appliances. It's not to be confused with a blanket mortgage (multiple properties) or a construction-to-perm loan."

        },
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If an existing loan is *assumed* by a new buyer and the original borrower (seller) is released from liability, a *novation* has occurred—essentially substituting the buyer as the new debtor on the loan with the lender’s consent. \"Subject to\" means the buyer takes over payments without formal assumption (seller remains liable). A wraparound is a different seller-financed arrangement, and equity exchange involves trading properties."

        "explanation": "Construction loans are usually *short-term* (e.g., 6 months to 1-2 years) and often have higher interest rates. The funds are typically advanced in *draws* or installments as construction milestones are completed, rather than a full lump sum upfront. Once construction is complete, the loan is often refinanced or \"taken out\" by a permanent mortgage."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "*FHA loans* are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (part of HUD). The FHA does not lend money directly; approved lenders issue the loans, and FHA insures them. FHA loans require a small down payment (often 3.5%) and have mortgage insurance premiums (both an upfront MIP and monthly MIP).

        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "RESPA is a federal law aimed at *consumer protection in home purchases*. It requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures of settlement costs (such as the Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure under TRID) and prohibits certain practices like *kickbacks* or referral fees between settlement service providers (like between a lender and a real estate agent).

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "RESPA prohibits a seller (or lender) from requiring a home buyer to use a particular title insurance company, as a condition of the sale, if the purchase is a federally related mortgage loan. It also bans kickbacks and unearned referral fees among service providers. Providing timely Loan Estimates and using Closing Disclosures are required by TRID (under RESPA/TILA). Charging fees for actual services is not a RESPA violation (as long as fees are for work done, not kickbacks)."

        "explanation": "Regulation Z (Truth in Lending Act) requires that if an advertisement for credit *contains certain trigger terms* (for example, the amount of a payment, the down payment, interest rate, term of loan), then the ad must include required disclosures such as the **APR** (Annual Percentage Rate), amount or percentage of down payment, terms of repayment, and whether an increase is possible.

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Under TRID, the borrower must receive the *Closing Disclosure* at least **3 business days before** the consummation of the loan (generally the closing date). This is to allow the borrower time to review final terms and costs. The Loan Estimate must be provided within 3 business days of application.

It prohibits discrimination in credit lending on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant is of legal age to contract), or because an applicant’s income derives from public assistance, or because the applicant has exercised rights under consumer credit protection laws. It’s broader than the Fair Housing Act (which doesn’t include age, marital status, etc.).

          "D": "The interest rate cannot change from that moment"
        },
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A loan commitment is the lender’s formal offer to lend, outlining the terms (loan amount, interest rate if locked, conditions, etc.) and indicating the loan is approved as long as specified conditions are met. It is the result of a successful underwriting process. It does not itself fund the loan or guarantee a rate (unless the rate was locked in the commitment)."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A *prepayment penalty* is a clause that requires the borrower to pay a fee if they pay off the loan early (before a specified period). This compensates the lender for the interest they expected to earn. Not all loans have prepayment penalties; many residential mortgages today do not, or they may be limited in duration.

        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Negative amortization occurs when the payments are not enough to pay all the interest due, so the unpaid interest is added to the principal balance, causing the loan balance to increase. This can happen in certain ARM loans or payment option mortgages where a minimum payment may be less than the interest accrual. It means the borrower could owe more than originally borrowed if only making the minimal payment."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Homeowners refinance primarily to benefit from *lower interest rates*, which can reduce their monthly payment or shorten the loan term (or sometimes to cash out equity). Refinancing replaces the old loan with a new one at current rates. It doesn’t eliminate property taxes or insurance obligations (those are still owed as part of owning a home, though not necessarily through the lender), and it doesn’t eliminate all interest, but it can reduce the total interest paid over time if the rate and/or term are improved."

Commonly, a homebuyer will use a bridge loan to pull out equity from their current home (or otherwise obtain funds) to use as a down payment on a new home, then pay off the bridge loan once the old home sells.

        "explanation": "A contract formed under duress (threats/force) or by fraudulent misrepresentation is *voidable* by the injured party. They can choose to enforce it or rescind it. It is not automatically void – it’s valid until the harmed party takes action to void it. (There may also be separate criminal or civil penalties for the wrongdoing, but the contract itself is voidable in terms of enforceability.)"

          "A": "It amends the original offer, which remains open until the counteroffer is accepted.",

        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A counteroffer is both a rejection of the original offer and a new offer in itself. The original offeree (who makes the counter) becomes the new offeror, and the original offeror can then accept or reject. The original offer cannot later be accepted once it’s been countered; it’s considered terminated."

          "D": "Mutual rescission by agreement of both parties"
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "If one party breaches, that party cannot simply unilaterally rescind the contract to avoid consequences (that’s not a legal remedy; it’s just a breach). Remedies for breach include *specific performance* (a court order forcing completion, often sought by buyers), *monetary damages* (actual damages or liquidated damages if pre-agreed in contract), and *mutual rescission* (if both parties agree to cancel the contract and usually return deposits, etc.)."

        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "When a contract states “time is of the essence,” it means that the parties must perform their obligations by the specified dates and times exactly. Deadlines are strict; failure to meet a deadline is considered a breach. Without that clause, a slight delay might be treated more leniently (within a \"reasonable time\")."

          "D": "Requiring the breaching party to perform the contract as agreed"
        },
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Liquidated damages are a sum agreed upon in the contract to serve as compensation if one party breaches. In real estate sales contracts, a common example is the *earnest money deposit* being retained by the seller if the buyer defaults (provided the contract specifies the deposit as liquidated damages). It's a pre-set remedy. Specific performance (forcing performance) is a different remedy, and actual damages are proved losses, not predetermined."

Mutual rescission releases both parties from obligations and usually involves returning any deposits or considerations, putting them back in their pre-contract state. (Novation substitutes a new contract or party; assignment transfers contract rights to a new party; specific performance is a legal remedy to enforce the contract.)"

        },

        "explanation": "An *executory contract* is one that is not yet fully performed. In real estate, between the signing of a purchase agreement and the closing, the contract is executory (duties like inspections, financing, and the actual transfer of title are still outstanding). Once a contract’s terms have been completely performed by all parties (for example, after closing), it is considered executed (fully executed)."

The seller holds legal title during the executory period, but cannot substantially impair the buyer’s rights. Equitable title gives the buyer an insurable interest in the property, and the right to demand conveyance of legal title per the contract terms."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A *listing agreement* (or a buyer’s agency agreement) is an employment contract – it’s an agreement by which a principal (seller or buyer) hires a real estate broker to perform services (find a buyer, find a property, etc.). It is not a transfer of real estate interest itself, but rather a personal service contract. The purchase and sale agreement is between buyer and seller for the property, not an employment contract."

        "explanation": "In an *exclusive agency listing*, the owner reserves the right to sell the property herself without owing a commission.

        "explanation": "A listing agreement (which is a personal service contract) can be terminated by mutual agreement, expiration, performance (sale), destruction of the property, or operation of law (like death or bankruptcy of seller or broker). A seller’s unilateral decision not to sell (without broker’s consent) is a potential *breach* of contract, not a valid termination. The broker could be owed damages or commission in that case."

In a purchase contract, unless prohibited, the buyer often can assign the contract to someone else. However, the assignor may remain secondarily liable unless there’s a novation (new contract) could release the original party.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The earnest money deposit is not legally required for a valid contract (consideration is provided by the mutual promises), but it *demonstrates the buyer’s good faith* intent to carry through with the purchase. If the buyer breaches without excuse, the deposit may serve as *liquidated damages* if so agreed in the contract (often being forfeited to the seller).

        "explanation": "If the purchase contract included a liquidated damages clause stating that the earnest money deposit would serve as damages in case of buyer default, then upon Betty’s unjustified failure to close, Seller Sam is entitled to keep the deposit as full settlement of damages.

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "A financing contingency protects the buyer. If the buyer diligently attempts but cannot obtain the loan specified, and they notify the seller per the terms, the contract typically *terminates* and the buyer’s earnest money is returned. Neither party is liable, because the contract was dependent on that condition.

The tenant (optionee) pays option consideration (which might be part of the rent or separate) for the *right* to purchase the property at a set price within a certain time.

        "explanation": "The listing broker must *present all offers* to the seller promptly (unless the seller has given specific written instructions to the contrary). In a multiple offer scenario, the broker should present all offers and help the seller objectively compare them. The broker should not disclose one buyer’s offer terms to another without the seller’s permission, as that could be against the buyers’ interests.

If the sole broker (with whom the seller listed) dies, the listing contracts terminate because the broker cannot perform. The seller would need to enter new listing agreements with a new broker if they still wish to sell.

        "explanation": "In a *sublease*, the original tenant (lessee) retains some interest (usually a reversion at the end of the sublease term) and remains liable to the landlord for the lease. The subtenant pays rent to the original tenant, who in turn remains responsible for rent to the landlord. In contrast, an *assignment* is when the original tenant transfers all remaining lease interest to a new tenant, who then pays the landlord directly; the original tenant may remain secondarily liable unless released."

          "A": "A written listing agreement between a seller and broker",
          "B": "An agent shows a series of homes to a buyer, gives advice, and negotiates on the buyer’s behalf without any written agreement or clear discussion of agency",

        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Implied agency can arise through the *actions* of the parties, even without an explicit agreement. If an agent treats a buyer as if they are represented – by advising them on prices, negotiating for them, etc. – a buyer agency relationship might be implied, and the agent could owe the buyer duties of loyalty, confidentiality, etc. (and risk dual agency if the agent also represents the seller). It’s best practice (and legally required in many states) to clarify, in writing, whom you represent to avoid unintended implied agency."

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Fiduciary duties can be remembered by the acronym OLD CAR: Obedience, Loyalty, Disclosure, Confidentiality, Accounting, and Reasonable care/skill. *Profitability* is not an agent’s duty (the agent’s job is to act in the client’s best interests, which doesn’t always mean making a profit, e.g., selling at any price)."

        },
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The agent’s duty of *loyalty* (and confidentiality) to the seller prohibits sharing the seller’s confidential willingness to accept a lower price without the seller’s permission. The agent must always put the client’s interests first. The acceptable price is confidential. (On the flip side, the agent must not misrepresent or lie to the buyer, but the agent is not obligated to volunteer the seller’s bottom line.)"

        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "While an agent owes *obedience* to the client’s lawful instructions, an agent must **never** obey illegal or unethical instructions. In this case, the seller’s request is discriminatory and illegal under fair housing laws. The agent should refuse such an instruction and should withdraw from the listing if the seller insists on illegal discrimination.

        "answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Under the fiduciary duty of *disclosure* (sometimes called full disclosure), an agent must inform the principal of any information that is material to the transaction or the principal’s interests. This includes presenting *all offers* (unless instructed otherwise by the client), and conveying any information learned about the other party that could influence the client’s decisions (such as the other party’s motivations or willingness to negotiate).

        "explanation": "The duty of *accounting* requires an agent to properly handle and account for all money and property entrusted to them by the client. Mixing (commingling) client funds with personal or business funds, or misusing client funds (conversion), is a serious breach of this duty and is illegal.

This includes not divulging things like a seller’s bottom-line price or a buyer’s maximum price, motivation, personal circumstances, etc. This duty survives even after the agency relationship ends. (Material property defects must be disclosed to buyers, as that’s a duty to customers and required by law – not covered by confidentiality to the seller because you can’t conceal defects.)"

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Dual agency arises when the same brokerage (or the same agent) has an agency relationship with both parties to the transaction – the buyer and the seller. Because of the inherent conflict of interest, *informed written consent* from both parties is required in states where dual agency is legal. In dual agency, the agent’s ability to fulfill all fiduciary duties (like full loyalty and disclosure) is limited, since they can’t favor one side over the other."

          "D": "Dual agency is legal in all jurisdictions without restriction"
        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A dual agent owes a limited fiduciary duty to both parties. They must not disclose confidential information of either party to the other and cannot advocate to the same extent as an exclusive agent would. Essentially, they act more as a facilitator once dual agency is established, aiming for a fair outcome without favoring one side. They cannot, for example, tell the buyer the seller’s lowest price or the seller the buyer’s top price. Dual agency is not legal in all jurisdictions, and where it is, it requires disclosure and consent."

        },
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "*Designated agency* is a brokerage practice where two different agents in the same brokerage are designated by their broker to separately represent the buyer and the seller in a transaction. This way, each client has their own agent advocate, and only the broker is technically a dual agent. It helps minimize conflicts inherent in dual agency by keeping client information segregated between the two salespersons. It still typically requires disclosure and consent, but it allows nearly full representation for each side."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "A *transaction broker* (also known as a facilitator or intermediary in some states) assists with the paperwork and logistics of a transaction without representing either party as an agent. They owe duties of honesty, accounting, and required disclosures to both parties, but do not owe fiduciary duties like loyalty or advocacy.

        },
        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Subagency was common in the past: a broker working with a buyer, without a buyer agency agreement, could be a *subagent of the seller* via the MLS offer of cooperation. In that case, the cooperating broker owes fiduciary duties to the seller (the listing broker’s client) and must act in the seller’s best interests, while the buyer is treated as a customer (owed honesty and disclosure of material facts, but not loyalty or advocacy). Many states have limited or discouraged subagency in favor of buyer agency."

        "explanation": "Implied agency can arise through the actions of the parties. If an agent behaves as the buyer’s representative – advising on prices, negotiating terms – without a formal agreement, an agency might be implied, meaning the agent could owe fiduciary duties to the buyer. This can inadvertently create undisclosed dual agency if the agent also represents the seller. It’s best to establish agency relationships explicitly in writing."

For instance, a listing agent should inform a prospective buyer if they represent the seller, and a buyer’s agent should disclose their role to a seller or listing agent upon initial interactions.

          "D": "Update the standard forms for real estate contracts"
        },
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "The Board is required to make an **annual report** of its proceedings, including an accounting of income and expenses, to the Governor and the state. (This is a common requirement for state boards.) It does not itself update standard contracts (those are produced by legal committees or REALTOR® associations, not the state Board), nor does it individually administer all exams (it delegates exam administration to a testing vendor)."

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Massachusetts law requires the Board to hold at least **four meetings each year** (quarterly).

        "explanation": "A licensee who disagrees with a disciplinary decision of the Board has the right to appeal the Board’s action through the courts (judicial review). There are specific time frames and procedures (often through filing a complaint in superior court under Chapter 30A of MA laws). The Board’s decision is not necessarily final if due process is sought in court."

Massachusetts law exempts certain parties: property owners dealing with their own property, attorneys acting in their professional capacity, auctioneers or public officials performing official duties (like court-ordered sales), among others:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.

Broker candidates must also complete additional education (another 40-hour course) and pass the broker exam.

(They do still have to apply and pay fees for the license.) This recognizes their legal expertise.

        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "If a license is inactive (for example, the person did not complete continuing education or chooses not to actively practice), the person **cannot perform real estate brokerage services** for the public. However, Massachusetts law does allow an inactive licensee to *receive referral fees* for referring prospective clients to an active broker:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. The license can be reactivated by fulfilling the renewal and education requirements. Inactive is different from revoked – it’s essentially \"on hold.\""

        "explanation": "A salesperson’s license is only active under a particular employing broker. When a salesperson transfers to a different brokerage, the salesperson (and usually the new broker as well) must notify the Board of the change. The Board will update its records and issue a new license pocket card indicating the new affiliation.
